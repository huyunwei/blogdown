      <description>Probabilistic Models for Repairable Systerms When analyzing repairable systems, areas of interest may include assessing the expected number of failures during the warranty period, maintaining a minimum mission reliability, evaluating the rate of wearout, determining when to replace or overhaul a system and minimizing life cycle costs.
When the downtime of the repairable systems are short, the point processes are often the model of choice. A point process gives:
 N(t): a counting function that keeps track of the cumulative number of failures a given system has had from time zero to time t.</description>

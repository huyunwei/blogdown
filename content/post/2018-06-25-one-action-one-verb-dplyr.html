<h1>base::cbind vs dplyr::bind_cols</h1>
<p>I ran into some trouble while converting some my <a href="http://www.riskpredictions.info/2018/05/20/discrete-event-simulation-part-1/">codes</a> to tidyverse, and the bind_cols returned some error message:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Arguement 2 must be length 1, not 3&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Apparently, base:cbind recycle the 1-row dataframe, while dplyr::bind_cols does not.</p>
<p>A quick google gives me the github <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/3170">reply</a>.</p>
<p>The key message from the developer is:<br />
&gt; this would add a lot of complexity to the implementation, and allow for mistakes. You can already use add_column().</p>
<p>I am convinced, I was not trying to bind a dataframe, I was adding a column to the dataframe.</p>
<p>If it is different action, use a different verb(function).</p>

<p>I am trying to do everything in tidyverse, well, everthing data related. My default is to write codes in R notebooks. Then I am bothered by the slow loading of data from csv. I tried workaround like save data as RDA or even feather, so that I donâ€™t have to deal with slowness every time.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I tried to find out more, and to my surprise, the <code>read::read_csv</code> is times slower than <code>base::read.csv</code>, let alone the <code>data.table::fread</code></p>
<p>I spent hours to figure out why readr::read_csv was times slower than base::read.csv , let alone data.table::fread I reinstalled readr and tried all kinds of things, until I found the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/inline-notebook-display-is-slow-when-loading-data/5231">post</a> answered by <span class="citation">@jimhester</span>. It is clear in hindsight that interaction between the progress bar and the notebook kills the efficiency.</p>
<p>The default should be disabling progress bar in Notebook environment, and Jim logged this as an issue in <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/793">GitHub</a>, and hopefully we will see it fixed soon.</p>

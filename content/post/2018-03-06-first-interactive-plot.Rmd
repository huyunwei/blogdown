## Interactive Plot in Blogdown
Blogdown is to generate static HTML, according a [github answer](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/166) by the [author of Blogdwon](https://github.com/yihui) himself, the only way to embed a interactive Shiny app is to use `<iframe>`.

## Create a Shiny app and deploy it
The easiest to deploy a Shiny app is to use the [shinyapps.io](www.shinyapps.io) platform. Just follow the steps from the website after you sign up, and you shiny app is deployed, in 3 steps.
My first attemp is at https://riskpredictions.shinyapps.io/prob_plot/

## Create an iframe block in Blogdown

Follow the steps at https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html

`<iframe src = "https://riskpredictions.shinyapps.io/prob_plot/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen width = 800 height = 800>
</iframe>`

Here it comes:

<iframe src = "https://riskpredictions.shinyapps.io/prob_plot/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen width = 800 height = 800>
</iframe>

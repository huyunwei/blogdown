# base::cbind vs dplyr::bind_cols

I ran into some trouble while converting some my [codes](http://www.riskpredictions.info/2018/05/20/discrete-event-simulation-part-1/) to tidyverse, and the bind_cols returned some error message:
```
"Arguement 2 must be length 1, not 3"
```

Apparently, base:cbind recycle the 1-row dataframe, while dplyr::bind_cols does not. 

A quick google gives me the github [reply](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/3170).

The key message from the developer is:  
> this would add a lot of complexity to the implementation, and allow for mistakes. You can already use add_column().

I am convinced, I was not trying to bind a dataframe, I was adding a column to the dataframe.

If it is different action, use a different verb(function).
